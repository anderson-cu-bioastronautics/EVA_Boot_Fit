# Conclusions 

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first parametric foot SSM that captures and reconstructs dynamic motion.
The model was able to identity specific changes in foot morphology as they related to subject and kinematic parameters, and suggest footwear design techniques to increase fit and comfort. 
The model is able to reconstruct a full 3D model when parameter values are provided, which offers shoe and last designers a design starting point, and the ability to test their designs on a range of subjects throughout stance phase.
