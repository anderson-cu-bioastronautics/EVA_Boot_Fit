abstract = {Results of the 1987-1988 anthropometric survey of Army personnel are presented in this report in the form of summary statistics, percentile data and frequency distributions. These anthropometric data are presented for a subset of personnel (1774 men and 2208 women) sampled to match the proportions of age categories and racial/ethnic groups found in the active duty Army of June 1988. Dimensions given in this report include 132 standard measuremetns made in the course of the survey, 60 derived dimensions calculated largely by adding and subtracting standard measurement data, and 48 head and face dimensions reported in traditional linear terms but collected by means of an automated headboard designed to obtain three-dimensional data. Measurement descriptions, visual indices and a glassary of terms are included to help identify and locate dimensions. Also apearing in this report are descriptions of the procedures and techniques used in this survey. They include explanations of the complex sampling plan, compurter editing procedures, and strategies for minimizing observer error. Tabular material in Appendices A and C are designed to help users understand various practical applications of the dimensional data, and to identify comparable data obtained in previous anthropometric surveys.},

abstract = {The metabolic energy cost of walking is determined, to a large degree, by body mass, but it is not clear how body composition and mass distribution influence this cost. We tested the hypothesis that walking would be most expensive for obese women compared with obese men and normal-weight women and men. Furthermore, we hypothesized that for all groups, preferred walking speed would correspond to the speed that minimized the gross energy cost per distance. We measured body composition, maximal oxygen consumption, and preferred walking speed of 39 (19 class II obese, 20 normal weight) women and men. We also measured oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production while the subjects walked on a level treadmill at six speeds (0.50-1.75 m/s). Both obesity and sex affected the net metabolic rate (W/kg) of walking. Net metabolic rates of obese subjects were only ∼10{\%} greater (per kg) than for normal-weight subjects, and net metabolic rates for women were ∼10{\%} greater than for men. The increase in net metabolic rate at faster walking speeds was greatest in obese women compared with the other groups. Preferred walking speed was not different across groups (1.42 m/s) and was near the speed that minimized gross energy cost per distance. Surprisingly, mass distribution (thigh mass/body mass) was not related to net metabolic rate, but body composition ({\%} fat) was (r2 = 0.43). Detailed biomechanical studies of walking are needed to investigate whether obese individuals adopt novel energy saving mechanisms during walking.

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing. {\textcopyright} 1981, ACM. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we first revisit the spherical fitting problem and provide a new, more generic solution that includes intuitive parameters for curvature control of the fitted spheres. As a second contribution we present a novel real-time rendering system of such surfaces using a dynamic up-sampling strategy combined with a conventional splatting algorithm for high quality rendering. Our approach also includes a new view dependent geometric error tailored to efficient and adaptive up-sampling of the surface. One of the key features of our system is its high degree of flexibility that enables us to achieve high performance even for highly dynamic data or complex models by exploiting temporal coherence at the primitive level. We also address the issue of efficient spatial search data structures with respect to construction, access and GPU friendliness. Finally, we present an efficient parallel GPU implementation of the algorithms and search structures. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author(s).},

The central advantages of our approach compared to existing planar MLS include significantly improved stability of the projection under low sampling rates and in the presence of high curvature. The method can approximate or interpolate the input point set and naturally handles planar point clouds. In addition, our approach provides a reliable estimate of the mean curvature of the surface at no additional cost and allows for the robust handling of sharp features and boundaries. It processes a simple point set as input, but can also take significant advantage of surface normals to improve robustness, quality and performance. We also present an novel normal estimation procedure which exploits the properties of the spherical fit for both direction estimation and orientation propagation.

abstract = {Quantifying human femoral cortex morphology is important for forensic science, surgical planning, prosthesis design and musculoskeletal modeling. Previous studies have been restricted by traditional zero or one dimensional morphometric measurements at discrete locations. We have used automatic image segmentation and statistical shape modeling methods to create predictive models of baseline 3-D femoral cortex morphology on a statistically significant population. A total of 204 femurs were automatically segmented and measured to obtain 3-D shape, whole-surface cortical thickness, and morphometric measurements. Principal components of shape and cortical thickness were correlated to anthropological data (age, sex, height and body mass) to produce predictive statistical models. We show that predictions of an individual's age, height, and sex can be improved by using 3-D shape and cortical thickness when compared with traditional morphometric measurements. We also show that femoral cortex geometry can be predicted from anthropological data combined with femoral measurements with less than 2.3. mm root mean square error, and cortical thickness with less than 0.5. mm root mean square error. The predictive models presented offer new ways to infer subject-specific 3-D femur morphology from sparse subject data for biomechanical simulations, and inversely infer subject data from femur morphology for anthropological and forensic studies.},

abstract = {A statistical body shape model (SBSM) for children was developed for generating a child body shape with desired anthropometric parameters. A standardised template mesh was fit to whole-body laser scan data from 137 children aged 3–11 years. The mesh coordinates along with a set of surface landmarks and 27 manually measured anthropometric variables were analysed using principal component (PC) analysis. PC scores were associated with anthropometric predictors such as stature, body mass index (BMI) and ratio of erect sitting height to stature (SHS) using a regression model. When the original scan data were compared with the predictions of the SBSM using each subject's stature, BMI and SHS, the mean absolute error was 10.4 ± 5.8 mm, and 95th percentile error was 24.0 ± 18.5 mm. The model, publicly available online, will have utility for a wide range of applications. Practitioner Summary: A statistical body shape model for children helps to account for inter-individual variability in body shapes as well as anthropometric dimensions. This parametric modelling approach is useful for reliable prediction of the body shape of a specific child with a few given predictors such as stature, body mass index and age.},

abstract = {Shoulder injury is one of the most severe risks that have the potential to impair crewmembers' performance and health in long duration space flight. Overall, 64{\%} of crewmembers experience shoulder pain after extra-vehicular training in a space suit, and 14{\%} of symptomatic crewmembers require surgical repair (Williams {\&} Johnson, 2003). Suboptimal suit fit, in particular at the shoulder region, has been identified as one of the predominant risk factors. However, traditional suit fit assessments and laser scans represent only a single person's data, and thus may not be generalized across wide variations of body shapes and poses. The aim of this work is to develop a software tool based on a statistical analysis of a large dataset of crewmember body shapes. This tool can accurately predict the skin deformation and shape variations for any body size and shoulder pose for a target population, from which the geometry can be exported and evaluated against suit models in commercial CAD software. A preliminary software tool was developed by statistically analyzing 150 body shapes matched with body dimension ranges specified in the Human-Systems Integration Requirements of NASA ("baseline model"). Further, the baseline model was incorporated with shoulder joint articulation ("articulation model"), using additional subjects scanned in a variety of shoulder poses across a pre-specified range of motion. Scan data was cleaned and aligned using body landmarks. The skin deformation patterns were dimensionally reduced and the co-variation with shoulder angles was analyzed. A software tool is currently in development and will be presented in the final proceeding. This tool would allow suit engineers to parametrically generate body shapes in strategically targeted anthropometry dimensions and shoulder poses. This would also enable virtual fit assessments, with which the contact volume and clearance between the suit and body surface can be predictively quantified at reduced time and cost.},

abstract = {Anthropometric data are widely used in the design of chairs, seats, and other furniture intended for seated use. These data are valuable for determining the overall height, width, and depth of a chair, but contain little information about body shape that can be used to choose appropriate contours for backrests. A new method is presented for statistical modeling of three-dimensional torso shape for use in designing chairs and seats. Laser-scan data from a large-scale civilian anthropometric survey were extracted and analyzed using principal component analysis. Multivariate regression was applied to predict the average body shape as a function of overall anthropometric variables. For optimization applications, the statistical model can be exercised to randomly sample the space of torso shapes for automated virtual fitting trials. This approach also facilitates trade-off analyses and other the application of other design decision-making methods. Although seating is the specific example here, the method is generally applicable to other designing for human variability situations in which applicable body contour data are available.

abstract = {The high prevalence of foot pain, and its relation to foot shape, indicates the need for an expert system to identify foot shape abnormalities. Yet, to date, no such expert system exists that examines the full 3D foot shape and produces an intuitive explanation of why a foot is abnormal. In this work, we present the first such expert system that satisfies those goals. The system is based on the concept of model-based outlier detection: a statistical shape model (SSM) is generated from 186 3D optical foot scans of healthy feet. This model acts as a knowledge base which is then parameterized by one's demographic characteristics (e.g., age, weight, height, shoe size) through a multivariate regression. This regression introduces model flexibility as it allows the model to be fine tuned to a specific individual. This fine tuned model is then used as a baseline to which the individual's 3D foot scan can be compared using standard statistical tests (e.g. t-tests). These statistical tests are performed at each vertex along the foot surface to identify the degree and location of shape outliers. Our expert system was validated on foot scans from patients with hallux valgus and abnormal foot arches. As expected, our results varied per patient, confirming that feet with the same clinical classification still show high shape variability. Additionally, the foot shape abnormalities identified by our system not only agreed with the expected location and severity of the tested foot deformities, but our analysis of the full 3D foot shape was able to completely characterize the extent of those abnormalities for the first time. These results show that the combination of statistical shape modelling, multivariate regression, and statistical testing is powerful enough to perform outlier detection for 3D foot shapes. The resulting insights provided by this system could prove useful in both shoe design and clinical diagnosis.},

Cross-section shapes and derived dimensions were compared between the standing condition, first peak (P1), and midstance valley of two peaks (MSV) of vGRF during walking. Heel and Navicular cross-sections were more laterally inclined during walking than during standing by 6° on average. Compared to at standing, breadth of the cross-section in contact with the ground was wider at the heel and instep at timing P1, and was wider at the forefoot and narrower at heel at timing MSV. Medial length was longer and dorsal arch was higher during walking than during standing. Plantar arch height did not differ between the three conditions. The maximum difference in plantar arch height between standing and P1 was 1.3 mm, much smaller than the inter-individual variation of 7 mm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Context: Footwear performance and injury mitigation may be compromised if the footwear is not properly sized for an athlete. Additionally, poor fit may result in discomfort and foot injury such as fifth metatarsal stress fracture, foot deformities, turf toe, and blisters. Current footwear fitting methods consist of foot length and width measurements, which may not properly describe the shape of the individual foot, correlated with shoe size descriptors that are not standardized. Footwear manufacturers employ a range of sizing rubrics, which introduces shoe size and shape variability between and even within footwear companies. This article describes the synthesis of literature to inform the development and deployment of an objective footwear fitting system in the National Football League (NFL). The process may inform athletic footwear fitting at other levels of play and in other sports. Evidence Acquisition: Literature related to footwear fitting, sizing, and foot scanning from 1980 through 2017 was compiled using electronic databases. Reference lists of articles were examined for additional relevant studies. Sixty-five sources are included in this descriptive review. Study Type: Descriptive review. Level of Evidence: Level 5. Results: Current methods of footwear fitting and variability in the size and shape of athletic footwear complicate proper fitting of footwear to athletes. An objective measurement and recommendation system that can match the 3-dimensional shape of an athlete's foot to the internal shape of available shoe models can provide important guidance for footwear selection. One such system has been deployed in the NFL. Conclusion: An objective footwear fitting system based on 3-dimensional shape matching of feet and shoes can facilitate the selection of footwear that properly fits an athlete's foot.},

abstract = {In human gait analysis studies, the entire foot is typically modeled as a single rigid-body segment; however, this neglects power generated/absorbed within the foot. Here we show how treating the entire foot as a rigid body can lead to misunderstandings related to (biological and prosthetic) foot function, and distort our understanding of ankle and muscle-tendon dynamics. We overview various (unconventional) inverse dynamics methods for estimating foot power, partitioning ankle vs. foot contributions, and computing combined anklefoot power. We present two case study examples. The first exemplifies how modeling the foot as a single rigid-body segment causes us to overestimate (and overvalue) muscle-tendon power generated about the biological ankle (in this study by up to 77{\%}), and to misestimate (and misinform on) foot contributions; corroborating findings from previous multi-segment foot modeling studies. The second case study involved an individual with transtibial amputation walking on 8 different prosthetic feet. The results exemplify how assuming a rigid foot can skew comparisons between biological and prosthetic limbs, and lead to incorrect conclusions when comparing different prostheses/interventions. Based on analytical derivations, empirical findings and prior literature we recommend against computing conventional ankle power (between shank-foot). Instead, we recommend using an alternative estimate of power generated about the ankle joint complex (between shank-calcaneus) in conjunction with an estimate of foot power (between calcaneus-ground); or using a combined anklefoot power calculation. We conclude that treating the entire foot as a rigid-body segment is often inappropriate and ill-advised. Including foot power in biomechanical gait analysis is necessary to enhance scientific conclusions, clinical evaluations and technology development.},

abstract = {Safety shoe development is based on static foot measures, which are transferred to last design. However, workplaces are not just static (‘standing workplaces only'). The aim of the present study is to examine static and dynamic foot loading of workers to determine whether foot morphology changes between different loading situations. The results could be used to improve last and shoe design to improve the fit of safety shoes. 1024 workers at different industrial locations in Germany took part in the study. The DynaScan4D dynamic scanner system was used to measure static and dynamic foot morphology during different phases of ground contact. All scan variables were selected based on measures required in the last development process. Cohen's d (effect size) was calculated to identify individual differences between maximum values during the stance phase of walking and static values in standing. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify possible influencing variables with regard to differences between static and dynamic values. Several foot measures showed relevant differences between dynamic and static loading. Interestingly, most length, width, height, and angular measures increased during dynamic loading (compared to static loading), whereas all circumference measures decreased. None of the tested variables (age, BMI, gender) predicted the differences between the two loading situations. Most dynamic changes are practical relevant changes between static and dynamic loading. Regarding the fit of safety shoes, it seems appropriate to adapt these changes to the last or shoe design.},

abstract = {Footwear comfort is primarily determined by the fit between the foot and the shoe. Foot deformations that cannot be accommodated by the flexibility of the material of the shoe upper have to be dealt with by other adaptive means. The major purpose of this study was to determine foot deformations using nine foot dimensions-foot length, arch length, foot width, midfoot width, heel width, midfoot height, medial malleolus height of the most protruding point, lateral malleolus height of the most protruding point and ball girth-as well as the eversion/inversion of the foot while bearing weight. Each foot of 30 Hong Kong Chinese adults (15 males and 15 females) was laser scanned under the conditions of no body-weight (NWB), half body-weight (HWB) and full body-weight (FWB). The nine dimensions and foot rotation were determined with a computer program. The results show that the foot became significantly longer, wider, and reduced in height while everting with increased loading on the foot. The midfoot had relatively large changes in width and height when compared to the forefoot and rearfoot. Even though there were no obvious patterns between the left and right foot for both males and females, considerable differences did exist between the two feet of a few participants. Foot length as a percentage of stature changed from 14.94{\%} to 15.10{\%} to 15.13{\%} in males as the load on the foot increased from NWB to HWB to FWB, respectively. These percentages were 14.56{\%}, 14.72{\%}, and 14.77{\%} for females. Even though foot width was significantly correlated with the body weight of males, no such relationship exists in Hong Kong females. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Anthropological Society of Nippon.},

abstract = {The complex functions of feet require a specific composition, which is progressively achieved by developmental processes. This development should take place without being affected by footwear. The aim of this study is to evaluate differences between static and dynamic foot morphology in developing feet. Feet of 2554 participants (6-16 years) were recorded using a new scanner system (DynaScan4D). Each foot was recorded in static half and full weight-bearing and during walking. Several foot measures corresponding to those used in last construction were calculated. The differences were identified by one-way ANOVA and paired Student's t-test. Static and dynamic values of each foot measure must be considered to improve the fit of footwear. In particular, footwear must account for the increase of forefoot width and the decrease of midfoot girth. Furthermore, the toe box should have a more rounded shape. The findings are important for the construction of footwear for developing feet. Practitioner Summary: Until now, foot deformation has not been analysed in developing feet. The presented differences between standing and walking of 2554 children were obtained using a new dynamic 3D scanner system. The results show that especially differences between foot width and girth measures and angles must be considered in footwear construction. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

Only advancements in scanner technology enable recording of foot morphology during walking.Methods: Static and dynamic foot morphology of 2554 participants (6-16 years) were measured with DynaScan4D. Different foot measures corresponding to measures used in last construction were defined. Influences of gender, age, and body mass were calculated within the whole sample by multiple linear regression analysis and within matched groups by Student's t-test.Results: The results of multiple linear regression analysis show similar patterns in boys and girls. The explained variance (R2) of the differences between static and dynamic foot morphology is low. R2 is higher for the maximum dynamic foot measures where the respective static value mainly predicts the dynamic value. Relative maximum dynamic values of foot height, width, and girth are higher in overweight, younger, and male participants. The deformation of the instep height and the angle of the fifth toe differ between overweight and normal weight participants. Between boys and girls as well as children and adolescents there are differences in the deformation of the ball area.Conclusion: There are effects of gender, age, and body mass on dynamic foot morphology and deformation. The differences are small regarding the high variability. Thus, dynamic adjustments are applicable without customising to gender, age, and body mass. However, it is important to account for the high variability and for static and dynamic situations. This should be discussed with focus on use of resilient materials. These results can improve footwear design and thus contribute to healthy foot development. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

Methods: Univariate t-tests and multivariate discriminant analyses were used to assess 1) significant differences between men and women for each foot and leg dimension, standardized to foot length, 2) the reliability of classification into gender classes using the absolute and standardized variable sets, and 3) the relative importance of each variable to the discrimination between men and women. Results: Men have longer and broader feet than women for a given stature. After normalization of the measurements by foot length, men and women were found to differ significantly in two calf, five ankle, and four foot shape variables. Classification by gender using absolute values was correct at least 93{\%} of the time. Using the variables standardized to foot length, gender was correctly classified 85{\%} of the time. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that female feet and legs are not simply scaled-down versions of male feet but rather differ in a number of shape characteristics, particularly at the arch, the lateral side of the foot, the first toe, and the ball of the foot. These differences should be taken into account in the design and manufacture of women's sport shoes.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate sex-related differences in foot morphology. In total, 847 subjects were scanned using a 3-D-footscanner. Three different analysis methods were used: (1) comparisons were made for absolute foot measures within 250-270 mm foot length (FL); (2) and for averaged measures ({\%} FL) across all sizes; (3) the feet were then classified using a cluster analysis. Within 250-270 mm FL, male feet were wider and higher (mean differences (MD) 1.3-5.9 mm). No relevant sex-related differences could be found in the comparison of averaged measures (MD 0.3-0.6{\%} FL). Foot types were categorised into voluminous, flat-pointed and slender. Shorter feet were more often voluminous, longer feet were more likely to be narrow and flat. However, the definition of 'short' and 'long' was sex-related; thus, allometry of foot measures was different. For shoe design, measures should be derived for each size and sex separately. Different foot types should be considered to account for the variety in foot shape. Improper footwear can cause foot pain and deformity. Therefore, knowledge of sex-related differences in foot measures is important to assist proper shoe fit in both men and women.

Four hundred twenty-four feet and four men's running shoe lasts (U.S. women 6.0-9.5), which also are used for the manufacturing of women's shoes, were scanned in three dimensions. Six foot measures were quantified. Different foot types were classified using a cluster analysis. Comparisons were made between last measures and averaged as well as foot type specific foot measures. Differences in width measures between lasts and foot types vary substantially (0-9 mm). Length grading is similar for lasts and feet (differences {\textless} 1mm). Width grading is larger in lasts in comparison with average grading in feet (3.5-5.9 mm). Last design and grading should account for the sex-specific allometry in foot measures. The use of down-graded men's lasts for women's shoes has to be questioned. Therefore, sex-specific reference measures and wear tests should incorporate different foot types in different sizes to allow suitable implications for a proper design and grading of lasts.

abstract = {Objective This study has assessed age-related changes of foot morphology for developing appropriate footwear with particular reference to the elderly.
Methods Anatomical parameters such as foot length, circumference and height and ankle length, circumference and height were assessed in a sample of males (n = 577) and females (n = 528) divided into three age groups. The groups included young-adult, aged between 20 and 25 years; adult, aged between 35 and 55 years; and old, aged between 65 and 70 years individuals.
Results In terms of gender differences, in young-adult individuals the sex-related morphological differences observed, are just related to a significantly lower length of foot in females. In adult subjects morphological parameters investigated were significantly lower in females even after normalization for foot length. In old individuals, no differences of the parameters were found after normalization for foot length. Comparative analysis of morphometric data between young-adult and adult individuals revealed that the instep length was smaller in adults. The opposite was observed for the great toe and medial foot arch height. Length of ankle was higher in adult than in young-adult individuals, whereas ankle circumference and height were smaller. In old vs adult individuals foot circumference showed the most relevant age-related differences.
Conclusions Feet anatomy presents specific characteristics in different ages of life. The ideal footwear should take into account these characteristics. This is true primarily for the elderly for minimizing the risk of falls or of other problems related to inappropriate footwear.},

However, despite reports of poor foot health, the influence of obesity and overweight on adult foot morphology has received limited attention. The objective of this work is to accurately and appropriately quantify the foot morphology of adults who are overweight and obese. Methods The foot morphology of 23 healthy weight (BMI = 22.9 kg.m− 2), overweight (27.5 kg.m− 2) and obese (32.9 kg.m− 2) age (60 years) matched males was quantified using a 3D scanner (all size UK 9). Data analysis computed normalised (to foot length) standard anatomical measures, and widths, heights and circumferences of 31 evenly spaced cross-sections of right feet. Findings Anatomical measures of foot, ball and heel width, ball and heel circumference and ball height were all greater in the obese group than the healthy weight (P {\textless} 0.05). Cross-sectional measures were significantly wider than the healthy group for the majority of measures from 14 to 67{\%} (P = 0.025–1.000) of heel-to-toe length. Also, the obese group had significantly higher midfoot regions (P = 0.024–0.025). This increased foot height was not evident from anatomical measures, which were not sensitive enough to detect dimensional differences in this foot region. Interpretation Feet of obese adults differ from healthy and overweight individuals, notably they are wider. Data needs to avoid reliance upon discrete anatomical landmarks to describe foot morphology. In the obese, changes in foot shape do not coincide with traditional anatomical landmarks and more comprehensive foot shape data are required to inform footwear design.},

abstract = {Mining work boots provide an interface between the foot and the ground, protecting and supporting miners' feet during lengthy coal mining shifts. Although underground coal miners report the fit of their work boots as reasonable to good, they frequently rate their boots as uncomfortable, suggesting that there is a mismatch between the shape of their feet and their boots. This study aimed to identify whether dimensions derived from the three-dimensional scans of 208 underground coal miners' feet (age 38.3 ± 9.8 years) differed from the internal dimensions of their work boots. The results revealed underground coal miners wore boots that were substantially longer than their feet, possibly because boots available in their correct length were too narrow. It is recommended boot manufacturers reassess the algorithms used to create boot lasts, focusing on adjusting boot circumference at the instep and heel relative to increases in foot length. Practitioner Summary: Fit and comfort ratings suggest a mismatch between the shape of underground coal miners' feet and their boots exists. This study examined whether three-dimensional scans of 208 miners' feet differed from their boot internal dimensions. Miners wore boots substantially longer than their feet, possibly due to inadequate width.},

The current study examined the effects of footwear comfort on running economy. Thirteen male participants rated five pairs of shoes on perceived comfort.

A paired t-test was used to compare running economy in the most versus the least comfortable shoe conditions. The findings of the study indicated a significant improvement in running economy, 0.7{\%} on average, in the most comfortable shoe condition.

abstract = {Purpose: The purposes of this study were (a) to determine lower extremity anthropometric and sensory factors that are related to differences in comfort perception of shoe inserts with varying shape and material and (b) to investigate whether shoe inserts that improve comfort decrease injury frequency in a military population. Methods: 206 Military personnel volunteered for this study. The shoe inserts varied in arch and heel cup shape, hardness, and elasticity in the heel and forefoot regions. A no insert condition was included as the control condition. Measured subject characteristics included foot shape, foot and leg alignment, and tactile and vibration sensitivity of the plantar surface of the foot. Footwear comfort was assessed using a visual analog scale. Injury frequency was evaluated with a questionnaire. The statistical analyses included Student's t-tests for repeated measures, ANOVA (within subjects), MANOVA (within insert combinations), and chi-square tests. Results: The average comfort ratings for all shoe inserts were significantly higher than the average comfort rating for the control condition. The incidence of stress fractures and pain at different locations was reduced by 1.5-13.4{\%} for the insert compared with the control group. Foot arch height, foot and leg alignment, and foot sensitivity were significantly related to differences, in comfort ratings for the hard/soft, the viscous/elastic, and the high arch/low arch insert combinations. Conclusions: Shoe inserts of different shape and material that are comfortable are able to decrease injury frequency. The results of this study showed that subject specific characteristics influence comfort perception of shoe inserts.},

abstract = {Footwear comfort is an important factor in design, purchase and use of running shoes but current measures require multiple subjective assessments. Therefore, an objective and more reliable surrogate measure of footwear comfort would be of high relevance. In other research fields, perceived comfort was found to influence the variability of movement execution. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of perceived footwear comfort on the variability of running kinematics as a potential surrogate measure of comfort. Thirty-six recreational athletes ran in five different running shoes on an indoor track while their running kinematics were recorded using a foot-mounted tri-axial inertial measurement unit (IMU). Footwear comfort was measured through multiple subjective assessments. The relative variability of IMU data was determined across the swing phase of 45 gait cycles and compared between the most and least comfortable shoes. Lower footwear comfort was associated with lower kinematic variability especially in the second half of the swing phase but only for variables that are not directly linked to the forward propulsion during running and mainly describe frontal and transverse joint rotations. The constraints of an uncomfortable shoe may lead to the adaptation of a more monotonous running style with the goal to stay in the least uncomfortable movement path. This finding may partially explain a previously described higher injury risk when exercising in footwear of lower comfort, as more repetitive forces could increase the risk of overuse injury. The results of this study implicate the possible use of IMU-based kinematic variability as a surrogate measure of footwear comfort, which could complement subjective measures.},

abstract = {Objective: The shape of the current physical and computational surrogates of children used for restraint system assessments is based largely on standard anthropometric dimensions. These scalar dimensions provide valuable information on the overall size of the individual but do not provide good guidance on shape or posture. This study introduced the development of a parametric model that statistically predicts individual child body shapes in seated postures with a few given parameters. Methods: Surface geometry data from a laser scanner of children ages 3 to 11 (n = 135) were standardized by a 2-level fitting method using intermediate templates. The standardized data were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) to efficiently describe the body shape variance. Parameters such as stature, body mass index, erect sitting height, and 2 posture variables related to torso recline and lumbar spine flexion were associated with the PCA model using regression. Results: When the original scan data were compared with the predictions of the model using the given subject dimensions, the average root mean square error for the torso was 9.5 mm, and the 95th percentile error was 17.35 mm. Conclusions: For the first time, a statistical model of child body shapes in seated postures is available. This parametric model allows the generation of an infinite number of virtual children spanning a wide range of body sizes and postures. The results have broad applicability in product design and safety analysis. Future work is needed to improve the representation of hands and feet and to extend the age range of the model. The model presented in this article is publicly available online through HumanShape.org.},

abstract = {Human figure models included with today's high-end simulation systems are widely used for ergonomic analysis. Male and female figures can be scaled by inputting standard anthropometric dimensions, such as stature, body weight, and limb lengths to represent a large range of body sizes. However, the shapes of these scaled figures are often unrealistic, particularly for extreme body types, because only a relatively few dimensions of the figures are adjusted. Several software packages have the capability of adjusting the figure to match a body surface scan of an individual, but this capability is insufficient when individuals with a wide range of attributes must be simulated. We present a new figure generation capability in the Jack human modeling software based on a statistical analysis of laser scans of hundreds of men and women. A template mesh based on the Jack figure model was fitted to each scan, and a statistical shape model was created using principal component analysis and regression. The model was integrated within the Jack software to create Jack figures with highly realistic body shapes, usable natively with all simulation and analysis features.},

We formulate an optimization problem in which the degrees of freedom are an affine transformation at each template vertex. The objective function is a weighted combination of three measures: proximity of transformed vertices to the range data, similarity between neighboring transformations, and proximity of sparse markers at corresponding locations on the template and target surface. We solve for the transformations with a non-linear optimizer, run at two resolutions to speed convergence. We demonstrate reconstruction and consistent parameterization of 250 human body models. With this parameterized set, we explore a variety of applications for human body modeling, including: morphing, texture transfer, statistical analysis of shape, model fitting from sparse markers, feature analysis to modify multiple correlated parameters (such as the weight and height of an individual), and transfer of surface detail and animation controls from a template to fitted models. {\textcopyright} 2003 ACM.},

abstract = {We introduce the SCAPE method (Shape Completion and Animation for PEople) - a data-driven method for building a human shape model that spans variation in both subject shape and pose. The method is based on a representation that incorporates both articulated and non-rigid deformations. We learn a pose deformation model that derives the non-rigid surface deformation as a function of the pose of the articulated skeleton. We also learn a separate model of variation based on body shape. Our two models can be combined to produce 3D surface models with realistic muscle deformation for different people in different poses, when neither appear in the training set. We show how the model can be used for shape completion - generating a complete surface mesh given a limited set of markers specifying the target shape. We present applications of shape completion to partial view completion and motion capture animation. In particular, our method is capable of constructing a high-quality animated surface model of a moving person, with realistic muscle deformation, using just a single static scan and a marker motion capture sequence of the person.

abstract = {The purpose of the American College of Sports Medicine's (ACSM) exercise preparticipation health screening process is to identify individuals who may be at elevated risk for exercise-related sudden cardiac death and/or acute myocardial infarction. Recent studies have suggested that using the current ACSM exercise preparticipation health screening guidelines can result in excessive physician referrals, possibly creating a barrier to exercise participation. In addition, there is considerable evidence that exercise is safe for most people and has many associated health and fitness benefits; exercise-related cardiovascular events are often preceded by warning signs/symptoms; and the cardiovascular risks associated with exercise lessen as individuals become more physically active/fit. Consequently, a scientific roundtable was convened by the ACSM in June 2014 to evaluate the current exercise preparticipation health screening recommendations. The roundtable proposed a new evidence-informed model for exercise preparticipation health screening on the basis of three factors: 1) the individual's current level of physical activity, 2) presence of signs or symptoms and/or known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease, and 3) desired exercise intensity, as these variables have been identified as risk modulators of exercise-related cardiovascular events. Identifying cardiovascular disease risk factors remains an important objective of overall disease prevention and management, but risk factor profiling is no longer included in the exercise preparticipation health screening process. The new ACSM exercise preparticipation health screening recommendations reduce possible unnecessary barriers to adopting and maintaining a regular exercise program, a lifestyle of habitual physical activity, or both, and thereby emphasize the important public health message that regular physical activity is important for all individuals.},

abstract = {The ideal means of achieving perfect fit is to produce individual, tailor-made shoes. However, this method is expensive and unaffordable for most people. At the opposite end of the scale, companies would prefer to be able to make shoes in only very few sizes, but this would lead to poor fit for the majority of customers. Many sizes of shoe are therefore required to meet consumer requirements while still ensuring that the business is profitable. The exact number of sizes is decided according to the costs of production and raw materials, as well as the fitting requirements, while the sizes themselves are determined principally on the basis of shoe-last sizes. This chapter introduces the sizing of shoe lasts, and consequently also footwear, as well as grading, a process used to modify the standard shoe last to create different sizes. A number of different standard systems for sizing and grading are used worldwide; this chapter compares the differences among the systems and discusses new research on sizing and grading.},

@article{Grant2020,
abstract = {Introduction: Musculoskeletal models are important tools for studying movement patterns, tissue loading, and neuromechanics. Personalising bone anatomy within models improves analysis accuracy. Few studies have focused on personalising foot bone anatomy, potentially incorrectly estimating the foot's contribution to locomotion. Statistical shape models have been created for a subset of foot-ankle bones, but have not been validated. This study aimed to develop and validate statistical shape models of the functional segments in the foot: first metatarsal, midfoot (second-to-fifth metatarsals, cuneiforms, cuboid, and navicular), calcaneus, and talus; then, to assess reconstruction accuracy of these shape models using sparse anatomical data. Methods: Magnetic resonance images of 24 individuals feet (age = 28 ± 6 years, 52{\%} female, height = 1.73 ± 0.8 m, mass = 66.6 ± 13.8 kg) were manually segmented to generate three-dimensional point clouds. Point clouds were registered and analysed using principal component analysis. For each bone segment, a statistical shape model and principal components were created, describing population shape variation. Statistical shape models were validated by assessing reconstruction accuracy in a leave-one-out cross validation. Statistical shape models were created by excluding a participant's bone segment and used to reconstruct that same excluded bone using full segmentations and sparse anatomical data (i.e. three discrete points on each segment), for all combinations in the dataset. Tali were not reconstructed using sparse anatomical data due to a lack of externally accessible landmarks. Reconstruction accuracy was assessed using Jaccard index, root mean square error (mm), and Hausdorff distance (mm). Results: Reconstructions generated using full segmentations had mean Jaccard indices between 0.77 ± 0.04 and 0.89 ± 0.02, mean root mean square errors between 0.88 ± 0.19 and 1.17 ± 0.18 mm, and mean Hausdorff distances between 2.99 ± 0.98 mm and 6.63 ± 3.68 mm. Reconstructions generated using sparse anatomical data had mean Jaccard indices between 0.67 ± 0.06 and 0.83 ± 0.05, mean root mean square error between 1.21 ± 0.54 mm and 1.66 ± 0.41 mm, and mean Hausdorff distances between 3.21 ± 0.94 mm and 7.19 ± 3.54 mm. Jaccard index was higher (P {\textless} 0.01) and root mean square error was lower (P {\textless} 0.01) in reconstructions from full segmentations compared to sparse anatomical data. Hausdorff distance was lower (P {\textless} 0.01) for midfoot and calcaneus reconstructions using full segmentations compared to sparse anatomical data. Conclusion: For the first time, statistical shape models of the primary functional segments of the foot were developed and validated. Foot segments can be reconstructed with minimal error using full segmentations and sparse anatomical landmarks. In future, larger training datasets could increase statistical shape model robustness, extending use to paediatric or pathological populations.},

@article{Scott1993,
abstract = {A model of the human foot is proposed in which the foot is represented as eight rigid segments and eight monocentric, single-degree-of-freedom joints. The soft tissue under the foot is divided into seven independent sites of contact, or loading, and each of these is modelled as a nonlinear spring and a nonlinear damper in-parallel. The model was used to estimate the kinematics and kinetics of the foot during the stance phase of walking. The force sustained at each loading site was calculated from walking trials in which only portions of the foot landed on a small force platform. The position of the calcaneus was defined by surface markers, whereas the position of the distal segments were based upon chalk footprints and an estimate of the compression of the plantar soft tissue. The results suggest that the joints that constitute the longitudinal arch extend slightly when the forefoot is loaded. During push-off, these joints flex as the metatarsophalangeal joints extend. Similar kinematic results were estimated when the distal segments of the foot were defined by surface markers. The magnitude of the joint moments of force depended largely on the distribution of the load under the foot which varied considerably between subjects. The stable, yet resilient properties of the foot, as highlighted by this model, should be considered in three-dimensional dynamic models used to study human locomotion. The model provides an objective tool to quantify foot motion and loading, which may prove useful for describing foot function in normal and pathological conditions. {\textcopyright} 1993 Pergamon Press Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new protocol designed to track a large number of foot segments during the stance phase of gait with the smallest possible number of markers, with particular clinical focus on coronal plane alignment of the rear-foot, transverse and sagittal plane alignment of the metatarsal bones, and changes at the medial longitudinal arch. The shank, calcaneus, mid-foot and metatarsus were assumed to be 3D rigid bodies. The longitudinal axis of the first, second and fifth metatarsal bones and the proximal phalanx of the hallux were also tracked independently. Skin markers were mounted on bony prominences or joint lines, avoiding the course of main tendons. Trajectories of the 14 markers were collected by an eight-camera motion capture system at 100 Hz on a population of 10 young volunteers. Three-dimensional joint rotations and planar angles were calculated according to anatomically based reference frames. The marker set was well visible throughout the stance phase of gait, even in a camera configuration typical of gait analysis of the full body. The time-histories of the joint rotations and planar angles were well repeatable among subjects and consistent with clinical and biomechanical knowledge. Several dynamic measurements were originally taken, such as elevation/drop of the medial longitudinal arch and of three metatarsal bones, rear-foot to fore-foot rotation and transverse plane deformation of the metatarsus. The information obtained from this protocol, consistent with previous clinical knowledge, enhanced our understanding of the dynamics of the human foot during stance. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Gefen2000,
abstract = {A novel three-dimensional numerical model of the foot, incorporating, for the first time in the literature, realistic geometric and material properties of both skeletal and soft tissue components of the foot, was developed for biomechanical analysis of its structural behavior during gait. A system of experimental methods, integrating the optical Contact Pressure Display (CPD) method for plantar pressure measurements and a Digital Radiographic Fluoroscopy (DRF) instrument for acquisition of skeletal motion during gait, was also developed in this study and subsequently used to build the foot model and validate its predictions. Using a Finite Element solver, the stress distribution within the foot structure was obtained and regions of elevated stresses for six subphases of the stance (initial-contact, heel-strike, midstance, forefoot-contact, push-off, and toe-off) were located. For each of these subphases, the model was adapted according to the corresponding fluoroscopic data, skeletal dynamics, and active muscle force loading. Validation of the stress state was achieved by comparing model predictions of contact stress distribution with respective CPD measurements. The presently developed measurement and numerical analysis tools open new approaches for clinical applications, from simulation of the development mechanisms of common foot disorders to pre- and post-interventional evaluation of their treatment.},

@article{Wolf2008,
abstract = {Functional units in the human foot provide a meaningful basis for subdivisions of the entire foot during gait analysis as well as justified simplifications of foot models. The present study aimed to identify such functional units during walking and slow running. An invasive method based upon reflective marker arrays mounted on intracortical pins was used to register motion of seven foot bones. Six healthy subjects were assessed during walking and four of them during slow running. Angle-angle diagrams of corresponding planar bone rotations were plotted against each other and used to establish functional units. Individual functional units were accepted when the joints rotated temporally in phase and either (i) in the same direction, (ii) in the opposite direction, or (iii) when one of the two joints showed no rotation. A functional unit was generalized if all available angle-angle diagrams showed a consistent pattern. A medial array from the navicular to the first metatarsal was found to perform as a functional unit with parts rotating in the same direction and larger rotations occurring proximally. A rigid functional unit comprised the navicular and cuboid. No other functional units were identified. It was concluded that the talus, navicular, and medial cuneiform should neither be regarded as one rigid unit nor as one segment during gait analysis. The first and fifth metatarsals should also be considered separately. It was further concluded that a marker setup for gait analysis should consist of the following four segments: calcaneus, navicular-cuboid, medial cuneiform-first metatarsal, fifth metatarsal. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Lundgren2008,
abstract = {The aim of this work was to use bone anchored external markers to describe the kinematics of the tibia, fibula, talus, calcaneus, navicular, cuboid, medial cuneiform, first and fifth metatarsals during gait. Data were collected from six subjects. There was motion at all the joints studied. Movement between the talus and the tibia showed the expected predominance of sagittal plane motion, but the talocalcaneal joint displayed greater variability than expected in its motion. Movement at the talonavicular joint was greater than at the talocalcaneal joint and motion between the medial cuneiform and navicular was far greater than expected. Motion between the first metatarsal and the medial cuneiform was less than motion between the fifth metatarsal and cuboid. Overall the data demonstrated the complexity of the foot and the importance of the joints distal to the rearfoot in its overall dynamic function. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{VandenHerrewegen2014b,
abstract = {Multi-segmental foot kinematics have been analyzed by means of optical marker-sets or by means of inertial sensors, but never by markerless dynamic 3D scanning (D3DScanning). The use of D3DScans implies a radically different approach for the construction of the multi-segment foot model: the foot anatomy is identified via the surface shape instead of distinct landmark points. We propose a 4-segment foot model consisting of the shank (Sha), calcaneus (Cal), metatarsus (Met) and hallux (Hal). These segments are manually selected on a static scan. To track the segments in the dynamic scan, the segments of the static scan are matched on each frame of the dynamic scan using the iterative closest point (ICP) fitting algorithm. Joint rotations are calculated between Sha-Cal, Cal-Met, and Met-Hal. Due to the lower quality scans at heel strike and toe off, the first and last 10{\%} of the stance phase is excluded. The application of the method to 5 healthy subjects, 6 trials each, shows a good repeatability (intra-subject standard deviations between 1° and 2.5°) for Sha-Cal and Cal-Met joints, and inferior results for the Met-Hal joint ({\textgreater}3°). The repeatability seems to be subject-dependent. For the validation, a qualitative comparison with joint kinematics from a corresponding established marker-based multi-segment foot model is made. This shows very consistent patterns of rotation. The ease of subject preparation and also the effective and easy to interpret visual output, make the present technique very attractive for functional analysis of the foot, enhancing usability in clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p ≫ n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso. {\textcopyright} 2005 Royal Statistical Society.},

@article{Jurca2019,
abstract = {For decades, footwear brands have developed products using outdated methods and measurements, working with limited insight into the foot shapes and dimensions of their target customers. The integration of 3D scanning technology into footwear retail stores has made it possible for this research to analyze a database containing a large number of male and female 3D foot scans collected across North America, Europe, and Asia. Foot scans were classified into length classes with 5mm length increments; mean width, instep height, and heel width were calculated for each length class. This study confirms the existence of many statistically significant differences in mean foot measurements amongst the regions and between the sexes, and a large dispersion of foot measurements within each group of customers. Therefore, shoes should be developed separately for each group, region, and sex, and at least 3 shoe widths per length class are required to provide a proper fit for 90{\%} of customers. Beyond this, our analysis asserts that a shoe designed for a single group will fit a different segment of the population in another group, and that existing last grading tables should be updated to reflect the foot dimensions of current consumers.},
